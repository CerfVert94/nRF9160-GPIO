# nRF9160-GPIO

A sample code to control GPIO of microcontroller nRF9160.<br>
The code is written in 2018, using Segger Embedded Studio.<br>
It should be cleaned up and it needs maintainance...<br>
but this is unlikely to happen as the author doesn't have the microcontroller in his possession anymore.<br>
